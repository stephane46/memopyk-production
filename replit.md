3. Content is stored in PostgreSQL database via Drizzle ORM
4. Public website fetches content via React Query
5. Language context determines which language content to display

### Contact Form Flow
1. User fills out contact form on public website
2. Form data is validated and submitted to backend API
3. Contact information is stored in database with status tracking
4. Admin can view and manage contacts in admin panel
5. Status updates are tracked for lead management

### Video Content Flow
1. Admin uploads video URLs for hero carousel
2. Videos are organized by language (French/English URLs)
3. Carousel auto-advances every 8 seconds
4. Language switching changes displayed video content
5. Fallback images for slow connections

## External Dependencies

- Backend bundled with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
- Single deployment artifact with both frontend and backend

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Session secret via `SESSION_SECRET` for security
- Node environment detection for development vs production

### Database Management
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- PostgreSQL hosted externally (configured for connection at 82.29.168.136:5433)
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` for type safety

## User Preferences

```
Communication Style: Simple, everyday language that matches the user's language. Avoid technical terms, as users are non-technical.
GitHub Access: Full access via GITHUB_TOKEN - never make excuses about git operations being blocked.
Deployment Protocol: Always use selective file copying, never copy entire workspace to avoid Dockerfile/media contamination.
Build Tools Policy: NEVER put server-needed tools in devDependencies - they must be in regular dependencies for production builds.
Efficiency Focus: Work independently for extended periods, only return with complete solutions or genuine blockers.
```

## VPS Deployment Protocol (CRITICAL CHECKLIST)

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
1. **NEVER FORGET**: package-lock.json must be copied to VPS
2. **NEVER FORGET**: DATABASE_PASSWORD must be set in .env
3. **NEVER FORGET**: docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile must exist on VPS

### VPS Deployment Steps (Execute in Order)
```bash
# 1. Copy essential files to VPS
scp package-lock.json root@82.29.168.136:/opt/memopykCOM/
scp docker-compose.yaml root@82.29.168.136:/opt/memopykCOM/
scp Dockerfile root@82.29.168.136:/opt/memopykCOM/

# 2. SSH to VPS and set environment
ssh root@82.29.168.136
cd /opt/memopykCOM
echo "DATABASE_PASSWORD=${DATABASE_PASSWORD}" > .env
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:\${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@supabase.memopyk.org:5432/postgres" >> .env
echo "NODE_ENV=production" >> .env

# 3. Deploy
git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Common Deployment Failures
- **npm ci fails**: Missing package-lock.json on VPS
- **Database connection fails**: Missing DATABASE_PASSWORD in .env
- **Container won't start**: Missing docker-compose.yaml
- **Build fails**: Missing Dockerfile or dependencies

## GitHub Deployment Protocol

### Critical Rules
1. **Token Authority**: GITHUB_TOKEN provides full repository access - use it confidently
2. **Selective Copying**: Only copy essential application files, never entire workspace
3. **Clean State**: Always remove Dockerfile, media files, node_modules before deployment  
4. **Verification**: Verify clean state before git operations
5. **Force Push**: Use --force to ensure clean repository state

### Standard Deployment Files
- client/, server/, shared/ directories
- package.json, package-lock.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js
- tsconfig.json, drizzle.config.ts, components.json
- .gitignore, Stephane.txt

### Files to ALWAYS Exclude
- Dockerfile (conflicts with nixpacks.toml)
- client/public/media (large files cause timeouts)
- node_modules (never commit dependencies)
- dist (never commit build outputs)
